# N20-Emission-Prediction
Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential 298 times greater than that of CO2. In agricultural soils, N2O emissions are influenced by a large number of environmental characteristics and crop management techniques that are not systematically reported in experiments.  We aimed to predict N2O emission on the basis of local information, to rank environmental and crop management variables according to their influence on N2O emission.
